# Airline_Delay_Dashboard_PowerBI
Airline Flight Delay Analytics using PowerBI

# Problem Statement
Records for **5,000,000+ commercial airline flights** in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.

## Recommended Analysis

    1. How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?

    2. What percentage of flights in experienced a departure delay in 2015? Among those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?

    3. How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year? What about for flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically?

    4. How many flights were cancelled in 2015? What % of cancellations were due to weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?

    5. Which airlines seem to be most and least reliable, in terms of on-time departure?
    
# Approach
Analysed **5.82Mn rows data** across **30 fields** to determine flight volume variations, departure delay percentages and times, cancellations causes and flight reliability of airlines from  **ETL(Extract, Transform & Load) to Visualization**.

# Outcome
Improved understanding of flight volume and delays through **data-driven analysis and recommendations**, enhancing operational efficiency and informed decision-making.
